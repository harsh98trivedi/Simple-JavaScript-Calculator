## What Makes This Calculator Special?

- **It does math** (obviously) – basic stuff like +, −, ×, ÷, %, and advanced moves like √, x², and x^y.
- **Looks good while doing it** – buttery-smooth buttons, subtle hover effects, and gradients that actually make sense.
- **Dark Mode** – because math at night shouldn’t hurt your eyes.
- **History Tracking** – remembers your last 50 calculations, because everyone forgets the answer sometimes.
- **Keyboard Friendly** – type numbers and operations directly. Bonus points for shortcut keys:
  - `D` → Toggle dark/light mode
  - `H` → Open/close history
  - `C` → Clear screen
  - `S` → Start a square root
